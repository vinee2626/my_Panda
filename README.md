# my_Panda- Movies on streaming platforms
This is my first try at operating over data-set.
The data-set used by me in this file is selected from kaggle.

I have performed several exploratory analytics over the movies data-set based upo the platform on which it is available, 
the genres of shows, age limit of movies, language and ratings of the movies. 

The libraries used in this project are  pandas and matplotlib.

# The following questions have been answered in the data exploration part of the project:
- Which comedy movies are available on Netflix?
- Which genre was the most viewed by the customers?
- Which language movie was preffered the most by the audience?
- Which movies should be advertised the most?

# To solve these questions, I went through several steps:
- Reading data from the csv file and creating a new DataFrame.
- Cleaned the data by dropping NaN values and eleminating unnamed column from the DataFrame.
- Used groupby to perform aggregate functions.
- Used string function to find the Genre of movies.
- Visualized the data with graphs.
- Used split function and loc function.
